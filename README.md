The macOS production build failed, and he lost his weekend, his daughter was in the hospital in New York with cancer, and he wanted to visit her this weekend. That weekend, he worked day and night... The cancer too! His daughter passed away. He wasn't informed, LOG: "fatal: eric@apple.com not found" on 14th of May, Monday... AND THAT MACOS BUILD REMAINED POSSESSED! BooOS!
